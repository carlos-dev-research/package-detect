# package-detect

A research project to evaluate object detection models for detecting packages. The goal is to study model performance before exploring continuous tracking.

## Motivation

Accurate package detection is a foundational step in logistics and warehouse automation. This project demonstrates a systematic approach to selecting, training, and evaluating models.

## Thought Process

The focus is on understanding model capabilities and performance differences. The workflow is structured to allow reproducible experiments and data-driven conclusions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   Identify and prepare datasets suitable for package detection.

2. **Model Selection**  
   Compare multiple object detection architectures to evaluate strengths and weaknesses.

3. **Training Pipeline**  
   Implement training, validation, preprocessing, and augmentation workflows.

4. **Evaluation**  
   Benchmark models using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP, and inference speed.

5. **Analysis**  
   Compare results to select the most effective model and understand trade-offs.

6. **Deployment**  
   Prepare the model for experimentation and future continuous tracking applications.
